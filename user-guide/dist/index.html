            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> The Host moves first and plays as X, the other plays as O. Each players take turns placing their symbol in empty squares.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Line up three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.</li>
                <li><strong>No Moves Left:</strong> When the board is full of symbols and neither party has won, the game ends in a tie.</li>
                <li><strong>Replay:</strong> When the game is finished, click on the <strong>Reset</strong> button to “leave” the match. Then you can host/join a new game.</li>
