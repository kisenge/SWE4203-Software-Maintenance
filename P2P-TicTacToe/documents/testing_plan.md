# Testing Plan
1. Adaptive-change: Organize project repository. -Simplifying folder structure.
   * Given the project repository, when users navigate through the project, then there shouldn't be redundent or empty folders within.
2. Corrective-change: Can't place opponent in middle sometimes xo- -*- --x *-cant place o here
   * Given the game is setup and it is the opponents turn, when the opponent attempts to place their 'o' character in the absolute middle of the game board which is empty, then the game should place their 'o' without trouble as it is a valid move.
4. Perfective-change: Center the x's and o's to the middle of the boxes.
   * Given two players are playing a game, when each player makes a valid move, placing their character on the board, then their character should be centered in each square area.
